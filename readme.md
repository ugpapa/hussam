# Learning JavaScript Concepts

This repository contains code files that cover various JavaScript concepts, including data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and asynchronous handling. The code files added in this push are as follows:

## Files

### 1. callback.js

- **Concepts Covered**: Functions
- **Description**: This file demonstrates the usage of callback functions in JavaScript highlighting their importance in asynchronous programming.

### 2. guess_number_async.js

- **Concepts Covered**: Loops, conditionals, async handling, functions
- **Description**: This file focuses on asynchronous handling in JavaScript. It introduces the concept of callback functions, using a number-guessing game as an example. It demonstrates how to handle asynchronous operations effectively to avoid blocking the execution of other code.

### 3. guess_number_sync.js

- **Concepts Covered**: Loops, conditionals, dtypes, functions
- **Description**: This file presents a synchronous version of the number-guessing game and utilizes `readline-sync` module. It showcases the usage of loops and conditionals to create a sequential execution flow. While it lacks the async handling features of the previous file, it emphasizes the fundamentals of control flow in JavaScript.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code files in this repository to better understand the covered concepts. Each file is self-contained and can be run independently.
